### 🧭 **Navbar (Top Navigation Bar)**

#### 🔹 **Structure**

A horizontal navbar pinned to the top with a slight shadow for depth. Responsive for desktop and mobile (collapsible menu on small screens).

#### 🔹 **Contents**

- **Brand/Logo**: Left side — e.g., “Teacher AI Hub” (text or icon-based)
    
- **Nav Links** (center or right aligned):
    
    - 🏠 **Home** – Scrolls or navigates to the landing page grid section.
        
    - 📚 **About** – Brief section or modal about the platform’s mission.
        
    - 💡 **How it Works** – Opens a section/modal explaining how to use the tool hub.

    - 🔐 **Login** – A button that routes to `/login` for the **dummy login page**.
        

#### 🔹 **Styling**

- Tailwind classes for spacing (`px-6 py-4`), background (`bg-white` or `bg-gray-100`), and flexbox (`flex items-center justify-between`).
    
- Hover transitions for links and CTA-style styling for the login button (`bg-blue-500 text-white rounded px-4 py-2`).

### 🧪 **Dummy Login Page (`/login`)**

#### 🔐 **Purpose**

To simulate a login experience and prepare for future integration with real authentication.

#### 🧱 **Layout**

- Centered login form (responsive, mobile-friendly)
    
- Input fields:
    
    - 📧 Email
        
    - 🔑 Password
        
- A **login button** that simulates authentication and routes back to the home or dashboard.
    
- Optional message: “This is a demo login. No credentials are required.”

    - A dummy handler simulates a successful login
        
    - The user is redirected back to the landing page or to a placeholder dashboard page (depending on your flow)
