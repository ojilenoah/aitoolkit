## **High-Level Product Description: Teacher AI Tools Hub**

The **Teacher AI Tools Hub** is a visually clean, responsive, and interactive **static web application** built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🖥 **Core Functionality Overview**

### ✅ 1. **Landing Page UI Design (Homepage)**

- **Layout**: A **responsive grid layout** built using Tailwind’s grid classes. This layout contains **feature cards**, one per category of teacher tasks.
    
- **Cards Design**: Each card is a **rounded rectangle with a subtle drop shadow**, a large icon or emoji, and:
    
    - A **bold title** (e.g., “Assignments”)
        
    - A **brief, punchy explanation** (e.g., “AI tools for creating engaging and efficient assignments in minutes.”)
        
- **Interactivity**: Clicking any card **opens a modal** using a React state hook that shows the tools for that category.

### ✅ 2. **Modal Functionality (React Modal)**

- **Triggered on card click**
    
- **Overlay modal** appears centered on the screen with:
    
    - A header (e.g., “Tools for Assignments”)
        
    - A **grid or vertical stack of buttons**, one per tool
        
    - Each button includes:
        
        - The tool's **name**
            
        - A **short description** (1–2 lines explaining what it does)
            
        - A **link to open the tool's website in a new tab**
